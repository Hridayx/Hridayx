I use tech to solve problems that matter and create real value (Say Hi to my Lego character!!)

With an AI & CompSci foundation from my undergrad, I like working across domains where code, data, and AI can provide Social Impact.

Currently exploring how AI fits into real-world environments where Reliability, Cost, and People matter as much as the Software.
